Many of these locations are unknown, preventing the wells from being plugged and their polluting effects averted. Remote sensing is a relatively unexplored tool for pinpointing abandoned wells at scale. We introduce the first large-scale dataset for this problem, leveraging medium-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our curated dataset comprises over 213,000 wells (abandoned, suspended and active) from Alberta, a region with especially high well density, sourced from the Alberta Energy Regulator and verified by domain experts.", "license": "cc-by-nc-4.0", "url": "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/t59p9aalqodm36h5vskge/AO_2J1nk5TpELDAH4l4RDE0?rlkey=ksa51mwmqk39q0cfsjn8fal7x&st=oib5sa9t&dl=0", "version": "1.0.0", "distribution": [{"@type": "cr:FileObject", "@id": "Train.tar.gz", "name": "Train.tar.gz", "contentUrl": "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/90tzje0ndukbccyh7699k/Train.tar.gz?rlkey=qewntwwefku8d31e0i724r8lg&st=5rmwzmwc&dl=1", "contentSize": "106671302105 B", "encodingFormat": "application/gzip", "sha256": "sha256"}, {"@type": "cr:FileObject", "@id": "Validation.tar.gz", "name": "Validation.tar.gz", "contentUrl": "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/t7xploy60rb4t32c79qvz/Validation.tar.gz?rlkey=qjsvufl29jxqvg0fw9cykusnt&st=p5hiqo7i&dl=1", "contentSize": "6029412103 B", "encodingFormat": "application/gzip", "sha256": "sha256"}, {"@type": "cr:FileObject", "@id": "Test.tar.gz", "name": "Test.tar.gz", "contentUrl": "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yezmzt0cx6mv1z3d9kz1p/Test.tar.gz?rlkey=o85irapbufr6qxxa30tsauh8n&st=odj9l3fc&dl=1", "contentSize": "7580393970 B", "encodingFormat": "application/gzip", "sha256": "sha256"}], "recordSet": [{"@type": "cr:RecordSet", "@id": "split_enums", "name": "split_enums", "data": [{"name": "train", "url": "https://mlcommons.org/definitions/training_split"}, {"name": "val", "url": "https://mlcommons.org/definitions/validation_split"}, {"name": "test", "url": "https://mlcommons.org/definitions/test_split"}], "description": "Maps split names to semantic values.", "key": "name", "field": [{"@type": "cr:Field", "@id": "split_enums/name", "name": "name", "description": "One of: train, val, test.", "dataType": "sc:Text"}, {"@type": "cr:Field", "@id": "split_enums/url", "name": "url", "description": "Corresponding mlcommons.org definition URL", "dataType": ["sc:URL", "wd:Q3985153"]}]}], "rai:dataCollection": "The key stages include monthly well status data acquisition from the Alberta Energy Regulator, quality control and filtering with domain experts, geographical image patch boundary creation, custom geography-aware clustering-based data splitting, satellite imagery acquisition, and label creation.", "rai:dataBiases": "A limitation of our study is the reliance on well locations from the Alberta Energy Regulator, which may miss some sites, potentially resulting in false negatives in the ground-truth data.

This dataset is based on Alberta, Canada, known for its diverse oil reserves and varied landscapes, providing a representative sample comparable to regions in the Appalachian and Mountain West areas of the United States, as well as some former Soviet states with oil wells and unidentified site issues.
